                <h3>Hi! I am Kailan!</h3>
                 <p> 
                    I am a <b>Computer Engineering</b> student at <i>UC San Diego</i> with a strong interest in systems that bridge <strong>hardware</strong> and  <strong>software</strong>. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My background spans from <span class="hardware">low-level programming</span> and <span class="hardware">embedded systems</span> to <span class="software">software development</span> and <span class="software">security</span>, giving me a holistic view of how technology works from the ground up.

                <p>
                    I enjoy solving complex, technical problems and turning ideas into functional, reliable systems. Whether I am optimizing performance at the hardware level or building efficient, user-focused software, I focus on understanding how each layer interacts to create something cohesive and meaningful.

                    I am continuously exploring new challenges that push me to learn and grow — particularly in areas like computer security, systems design, and hardware-software integration. Above all, I value clear thinking, precision, and building technology that works elegantly under the hood.

                    I enjoy building things. There is something satisfying about writing efficient code, optimizing resources, and understanding the hardware that lies beneath. Whether it is developing software tools, debugging embedded systems, or exploring security concepts, I value the discipline of engineering — the careful balance between elegance and practicality. <br>

                    Outside the technical side, I care deeply about the process of learning itself. I find joy in dissecting a new technology, running experiments, and documenting what works and what does not. I believe that good engineers are not just problem-solvers — they are pattern-seekers who recognize connections across domains and adapt to new challenges with humility and persistence. <br>

                <h2>Unprofessional interests</h2>
                <p>
                    
                    I love playing Dungeons & Dragons with my friends — there is nothing like diving into a story, creating a rougue character, and start to steal from every character I encounter. It is my favorite way to escape reality for a while and exercise my expertise to lockpick. (Don't worry, I cannot pick the easist lock even with a key by my side as the answerkey.)
                </p>

                <p>

                    I also loving going to gym and human watch. These amazing people with amazing techniques can move a huge weight without hurting their knees or backs or shoulders. In my mind, I would switch out their plates into equal weight of my friends, cats and dogs. At the same time, I would do some exercises to kill time in between the watch just to relax my eye muscles. (<em>Just kidding</em>, I am not a creep and I do not stare at people. I need to write something fun while doing this assignment.)

                    And I cannot forget  <a href="#random-stuff">ice cream</a> — it is the greatest human invention! Even Wonder Woman thinks so.
