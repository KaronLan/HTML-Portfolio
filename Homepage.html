                <h2>About me</h2>
                <h3>Hi! I am Kailan!</h3>
                 <p> 
                    I am a <b>Computer Engineering</b> student at <i>UC San Diego</i> with a strong interest in systems that bridge <strong>hardware</strong> and  <strong>software</strong>. <br />

                    My background spans from <span class="hardware">low-level programming</span> and <span class="hardware">embedded systems</span> to <span class="software">software development</span> and <span class="software">security</span>, giving me a holistic view of how technology works from the ground up.

                    I enjoy solving complex, technical problems and turning ideas into functional, reliable systems. Whether I am optimizing performance at the hardware level or building efficient, user-focused software, I focus on understanding how each layer interacts to create something cohesive and meaningful.

                    I am continuously exploring new challenges that push me to learn and grow — particularly in areas like computer security, systems design, and hardware-software integration. Above all, I value clear thinking, precision, and building technology that works elegantly under the hood.

                <p>
                    I enjoy building things that operate close to the metal. There is something satisfying about writing efficient code, optimizing resources, and understanding the hardware that lies beneath. Whether it is developing software tools, debugging embedded systems, or exploring security concepts, I value the discipline of engineering — the careful balance between elegance and practicality. <br />

                    Outside the technical side, I care deeply about the process of learning itself. I find joy in dissecting a new technology, running experiments, and documenting what works and what does not. I believe that good engineers are not just problem-solvers — they are pattern-seekers who recognize connections across domains and adapt to new challenges with humility and persistence. <br />

                    When I approach a new project, I try to design from the ground up, thinking first about structure, clarity, and intent. I appreciate modularity, maintainability, and systems that make sense under pressure. I also believe collaboration is key: some of my favorite work has come from exchanging ideas, reviewing code, and learning from others' perspectives.

                    I have got a mix of hobbies that keep me busy and happy in different ways. I love playing Dungeons & Dragons with my friends — there is nothing like diving into a story, creating a character, and going on crazy adventures where anything can happen. It is my favorite way to escape reality for a while and stretch my imagination.

                    When I am not rolling dice, I am usually at the gym or outside playing ball games. I enjoy pushing myself physically, whether it is lifting weights, running, or shooting hoops. Sports and exercise help me stay focused and energized for everything else in life.

                    And I cannot forget ice cream — it is my ultimate treat after a long day. Trying new flavors is a little adventure of its own, and it is a fun way to reward myself for staying active and creative.
